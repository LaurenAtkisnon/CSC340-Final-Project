# Tron.io

This project is a simple network game using the client-server model.
The game itself is based on Tron, where several players will compete
against one another and try to be the last one standing.  Each player continuously 
moves across a grid in one of four directions: north, south, east, or west.  As grid
locations are visited, they are highlighted on the screen as the color of the player.  A player
is eliminated from the game after colliding with either a boundary wall or a previously visited
grid location.  The "lines" generated by players are permanent and remain as obstacles even after
their originators are elminated from the game.

## Instructions:

1. Download the code in this repository.
2. Extract ZIP file in a folder on your computer.
3. Open a command terminal.
4. Navigate to the folder containing the code.
5. Compile all Java files by typing "javac \*.java."
6. Start the server application by entering "java GameServer.java [Optional Port]."
   - If the port argument is omitted, the server will use port 1340 by default.
   - Make note of the IP address of the machine running the server application.
7. Start the client application by entering "java App.java."
   - You'll notice that "127.0.0.1" is set as the default server IP/hostname and "1340" is set as the default port.
   - Only use "127.0.0.1" as the server hostname if the server is running on the same machine.
   - You can join the game as either a "player" or "spectator."
8. The game will automatically start once at least one other player has joined.
   - Players that join during the middle of a game session will be forced to watch the current session as spectators.
   - Once the round is over, any new players will automatically be added to the following round.
9. Press File -> Exit to leave the game server and close the application.
