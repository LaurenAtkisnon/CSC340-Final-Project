# Tron.io

This project is a simple network game using the client-server model.
The game itself is based on Tron, where several players will compete
against one another and try to be the last one standing.  Each player continuously 
moves across a grid in one of four directions: north, south, east, or west.  As grid
locations are visited, they are highlighted on the screen as the color of the player.  A player
is eliminated from the game after colliding with either a boundary wall or a previously visited
grid location.  The "lines" generated by players are permanent and remain as obstacles even after
their originators are elminated from the game.
